Encouraging the formation of ERGs and affinity networks is an important step towards building an inclusive and diverse workplace culture. This can be done by providing resources and support for employees who want to start these groups, as well as promoting the existence of these groups to all employees.

Providing Resources and Support

Providing resources and support for ERGs and affinity networks can include things like meeting space, funding for events or activities, and access to leadership or mentorship opportunities. By providing these resources, organizations demonstrate their commitment to supporting diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
